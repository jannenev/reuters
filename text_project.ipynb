    "The task is to learn to assign the correct labels to news articles.  The corpus contains ~850K articles from Reuters.  The test set is about 10% of the articles. The data is unextracted in XML files.\n",

    "Some comments and hints particular to the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One document may belong to many classes in this problem, i.e., it's a multi-label classification problem. In fact there are documents that don't belong to any class, and you should also be able to handle these correctly. Pay careful attention to how you design the outputs of the network (e.g., what activation to use) and what loss function should be used.\n",
    "- You may use word-embeddings to get better results. For example, you were already using a smaller version of the GloVE  embeddings in exercise 4. Do note that these embeddings take a lot of memory. \n",
    "- In the exercises we used e.g., `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to handle the loading of the data in suitable batches. Here, you need to handle the dataloading yourself.  The easiest way is probably to create a custom `Dataset`. [See for example here for a tutorial](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-custom-dataset-examples)."
